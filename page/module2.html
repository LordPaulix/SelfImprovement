    <p>
      Creating a paragraph with bolded <strong>word</strong> like this one, is
      one of the items I learned today.
      <br />
      The line break above this one also. I also learned how to put
      <em>emphasis,</em> which will make the word formatted in italics.
      <br />
      Embedding or placing image with links is the best lesson I had in this
      module.
